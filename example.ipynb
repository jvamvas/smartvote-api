       "   'questions': [{'info': '<p align=\"left\">The Swiss Federal Old Age and Survivors&rsquo; Insurance (AHV) is one of the key social security mechanisms in Switzerland, and is a key pillar of Swiss retirement provision. It is a mandatory form of insurance. The AHV pensions are designed to secure a basic standard of living, i.e. the absolutely necessary living requirements. Under the existing legislation the retirement age for men is 65, and for women, 64.</p>\\n<p align=\"left\">According to the Federal Office for Social Security (BSV), the AHV is currently in good financial shape. From 2020, however, the as yet stable financial situation of the AHV is set to deteriorate because the so-called &ldquo;baby-boomer generation&rdquo; will be reaching retirement age, and demographic developments (the ageing of the Swiss population) mean that the financial footing of the AHV will deteriorate.</p>\\n<p align=\"left\">The AHV is financed through the pay-as-you-go system. This means that the contributions from people who are of employment age pay for the current pensions of the older generations. Over the years to come, the number of Swiss pensioners is set to become ever greater in relation to the Swiss population which is of working age.</p>\\n<p align=\"left\">To address this imbalance between those of working age and the retired generation, it is proposed that the pension age is adjusted in line with increased life expectancy, so as to remove the financial burden that is increasingly being placed on the AHV system.</p>',\n",
       "     'contra': '<p align=\"left\">The AHV is in a healthy financial state, which means that the considerable political pressure to which it has been subjected for years is unjustifiable. Thanks to economic growth, immigration and increased productivity, the financial basis of the AHV is also growing, which means no increase in the pension age is necessary. Despite an increasing number of AHV pensions, when measured against gross domestic product, their proportion is stable. This is despite the unlimited contribution obligation up to the highest income. This means that the AHV has firm foundations.</p>\\n<p align=\"left\">The increase in the pension age also contradicts the realities of the labour market. This is because firstly, more and more people are taking early retirement &ndash; nowadays, only approximately half of 64 year old men are in work. Secondly, the additional jobs which would be required were there to be an increase in the pension age simply aren&rsquo;t there.</p>\\n<p align=\"left\">If a general increase in the pension age comes to pass, many employees will no longer be able to take early retirement. This will have a particularly strong impact on people who work in physically demanding occupations with a low income (the construction sector, for example).</p>',\n",

       "     'pro': '<p align=\"left\">The pension system has to be changed due to increased life expectancy and the fall in the number of births. Without an increase in the pension age, fewer and fewer people of working age will have to pay for more and more pensioners who are living increasingly long lives. At the moment, there are just 3.7 people of working age for one retired person. In 1948, when the AHV was introduced, there were 6.4.</p>\\n<p align=\"left\">From approximately 2019 onwards, the AHV is set to have consistently negative apportionment results. Changing the pension age is a better idea than reducing the payments or increasing the contributions. With a step-by-step, gradual increase in the pension age, the effects on people who are approaching retirement could be strongly relieved.</p>',\n",

For both economic and social reasons, the Confederation wants to promote the combination of professional and family life by creating favourable parameters, by subsidising day-care centres for children, for example.<br /><br />The Federal Law on Financial Assistance for Supplementary Childcare entered into force on 1st February 2003. This legislation involved the launch of a fixed-term stimuli programme which was eventually extended in 2010 for a further four years until the end of 2015. In September 2014, it was resolved to extend the programme for an additional four years until 2019 with a framework credit in sum total of 120 million Francs.<br /><br />In 2015, 26.5 million Francs from the annual budget are being spent on supplementary childcare (7.5 million more than in the previous year).

Accordingly, juvenile offenders are typically not punished but are re-socialized.<br /><br />The new Juvenile Criminal Code entered into force on 1st January 2007, and allows for sanctions to be applied in a differentiated way through a combination of protective measures and punishments. Even in the case of very serious offences, the maximum permitted term of imprisonment for a juvenile is four years.<br /><br />Under Swiss juvenile criminal law, greater importance is attached to so-called protective measures &ndash; for example personal mentoring and placement in treatment centres &ndash; than to withdrawing the offender's freedom. These measures are not limited to a specific term, but must come to an end when the offender turns 22 at the latest. At that point the offender must be released, irrespective of the offence committed and the assessed likelihood of re-offence.
